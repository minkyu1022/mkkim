    Summary:
      - "I'm a 1st-year Ph.D. candidate in at KAIST AI, advised by [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215). I majored in Mathematics, and recently led a project on scalable diffusion sampler for molecular conformer generation with sample-efficient training. Currently, I am developing generative models for catalyst design conditioned on adsorbates."
